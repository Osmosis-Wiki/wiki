# Based Degen WikiWork
We are completely run and operated by the Osmosis Community. This mean, we need help, not just mentally, but in terms of work needing to be done around the wiki.

## To Do

- [ ] Not be based
- [ ] Osmosis AMM (how do)
- [ ] OSMO and ION (the whole damn story)
- [ ] IBC and Cosmos
- [ ] Wallets - Mobile/Desktop (heavy preference for Kelpr)
- [ ] Staking (in general)
- [ ] OSL
	- [ ] Robo's Repair Desk
- [ ] OMM
- [ ] Governance (this one is um... larger than 1 bullet)
	- [ ] EIP-Like document/approach
  - [ ] Actions to take in #Crisis
  - [ ] Johnny's Governance Office (get your IBC passports here)
- [ ] DeFi Basics
	- [ ] The How do, the why do, the dangers of do
