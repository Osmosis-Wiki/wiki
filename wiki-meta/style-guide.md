# OsmoWiki Style Guide

> This is a **WORKING DOCUMENT**. That means that this page may change from minute to minute or hour to hour. If using this document as a reference, please be sure to check back often. *Information might change*.
{.is-warning}

As with any wiki, a guide must exist in order to follow the same set of style of pages through-out. This will be a living document, meaning, it will be edited and adjusted as time goes along and use cases increase. For now, we will be implementing some basics.

<!-- Insert Table of Headers here. -->

## Editor

OsmoWiki will be primarily using the `Markdown Editor` for all pages moving forward. In order to help with document production, we strongly recommended having [Wiki.JS's](https://docs.requarks.io/editors/markdown) markdown guide up while editing. This will make referencing the unique features of the wiki *very* easy. The Wiki JS editor also have some easy *WYSIWYG*-like features for the markdown editor.

While we won't disable the WYSIWYG editor, we would prefer that all pages and articles are produced directly in Markdown. This will allow for maximum compatibility if the wiki were to ever switch platforms, or for viewing on places like Github. Any page produced with the WYSYG editor will be converted to markdown and refactored (if needed) prior to posting.

If you're unfamiliar with markdown, please take a look at the guides provided:

- [CommonMark Spec](https://spec.commonmark.org)
	- [Wiki.JS Guide](https://docs.requarks.io/editors/markdown)
	- [Github Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
  
### Important Notes

1. The Markdown Editor **DOES NOT** do spell checking within it's editing box. Instead there is a spell check button in the top right of the preview window that will run a spell check. Using your browsers spell check **WILL NOT** auto update the markdown, you will have the correct the spelling, THEN copy the corrected word over into markdown editor.
1. The wiki is currently being produced in **ENGLISH** specifically, we will be following US English. (This will be revised as more articles are produced in different languages.)
