## What is "Decentralised Finance"
Decentralised Finance is describing a financial system that is built and operated in a decentralised manner. The most important aspect about decentralied finance is that no single entity should be able to control the product/system and that every important decision should be endorsed by the (majority of the) Community. Possible products that are decentralised Exchanges (Osmosis, Uniswap, Balancer, etc.) and money lending platforms (Curve, Aave, etc.).
