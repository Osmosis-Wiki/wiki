# Decentralized Finance for Newbies

> This article is stub, work that out... K...thx!

## What is "Decentralised Finance"
Decentralised Finance is describing a financial system that is built in a decentralised manner and operated on or through a Blockchain. This means, that in a DeFi application there is no intermediate between the different actors. So for instance on Osmosis, when a user makes a swap he is interacting directly with the liquidity providers without third party. To ensure a trustless process DeFi applications use rules which are defined in Smart Contracts or natively into a Blockchain. The Blockchain then enforces that every actor is complying to these rules. 

Possible DeFi applications are decentralised Exchanges (Osmosis, Uniswao, Balancer) or money lending platforms (Curev, Aave, etc.)
