# Decentralized Finance for Newbies

> This article is stub, work that out... K...thx!

## What is "Decentralised Finance"
Decentralised Finance is describing a financial system that is built in a decentralised manner and operated on or through a Blockchain. This means, that in a DeFi application there is no intermediate between the different actors. So for instance on Osmosis, when a user makes a swap he is interacting directly with the liquidity providers without third party. To ensure a trustless process DeFi applications use rules which are defined in Smart Contracts or natively into a Blockchain. The Blockchain then enforces that every actor is complying to these rules. 

Possible DeFi applications are decentralised Exchanges (Osmosis, Uniswao, Balancer) or money lending platforms (Curev, Aave, etc.)

## Risks/Vulnerabilities
DeFi applications also have risks which can affect the stored money and in the worst case and in the worst case lead to total insolvency. The first potential vulnerability is coming from bugs in the defined rules which could empower actors to access funds they aren't supposed to access. This already happened several times in the past and is the biggest risk DeFi applications have. In October 2021 a bug in the Compound Smart Contract put [$160M at risk](https://decrypt.co/82499/compound-exploit-drains-21m-from-lending-protocol). Also Osmosis suffered such a bug where 5M of funds in which $5M in liquidity was illicitly withdrawn.
Another potential vulnerability that DeFi applications are exposed to is when the blockchain on which the application runs is itself attacked. This could be achieved through a 51% attack where one entity controls the majority of the new blocks and therefore the whole network. If this happens it also controls all the funds that are stored in the network including the DeFi application. However, such an attack is unlikely on the major blockchain networks.
