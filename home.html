<h1>Welcome to the Wiki!</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The community run wiki for Cosmos SDK based App-Chain <a href="https://osmosis.zone/">Osmosis</a>. This wiki aims to be a go-to <i>community-validated</i> resource for anyone looking to join Osmosis as a community member, liquidity pool provider, developer, or otherwise, and to also provide links to official development resources, governance decisions, compilations of actions taken by the protocol and their reasonings, opinion pieces regarding any related topic, and to pull together the greater knowledge of the Cosmos Ecosystem. Sounds like a lot for a group of Crypto Degens, wanna help?</p>

<h2>What is Osmosis?</h2>
<p><strong>Osmosis</strong> is an advanced automated market maker <i>(AMM)</i> protocol that allows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Developers to build customized AMMs with <i>sovereign</i> liquidity pools by being built with the Cosmos SDK, and utilizing Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) to enable cross-chain transactions.</li>
  <li>Users to launch liquidity pools with unique parameters, such as, bonding curves and multi-weighted asset pools. Each pool also allows for any user to add any External Incentive.</li>
  <li>Unique and Governance controlled incentivization of individual liquidity pools, allowing for strategically targeted incentives.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Why Osmosis?</h2>
<p>Inspired by <a href="http://balancer.finance/whitepaper">Balancer</a> and Sunny Aggarwal's '<a href="https://www.sunnya97.com/blog/daoifying-uniswap-automated-market-maker-pools">DAOfying Uniswap Automated Market Maker Pools</a>', the goal for Osmosis is to provide the best-in-class tools that extend the use of AMMs within the Cosmos ecosystem <i>beyond traditional token swap-type</i> use cases. Bonding curves, while have found its primary use case in decentralized exchange mechanisms, its potential use case can be further extended through the customizability that Osmosis offers. Through the customizability offered by Osmosis, such as custom-curve AMMs, dynamic adjustments of swap fees, multi-token liquidity poolsâ€“the AMM can offer decentralized formation of token fundraisers, interchain staking, options market, and more for the Cosmos ecosystem. A great example of extending use cases from Osmosis' inception to now is available ðŸ”œ here.</p>
<p>Whereas most Cosmos SDK based zones have focused their incentive scheme on the delegators and staking rewards, Osmosis attempts to align the interests of multiple stakeholders of the ecosystem such as LPs, DAO members, as well as delegators. One mechanism that is introduced is how <i>staked liquidity providers have sovereign ownership over their pools</i>, and through the pool governance process allow them to adjust the parameters depending on the poolâ€™s competition and market conditions. Osmosis is a sovereign <a href="https://mapofzones.com">Cosmos Zone</a> that derives its sovereignty not only from its <i>application-specific blockchain architecture </i>but also the collective sovereignty of the LPs that has aligned interest to different tokens that they are providing liquidity for.</p>
<p>Osmosis is a fair-launched, customizable automated market maker for interchain assets that allows the creation and management of non-custodial, self-balancing, interchain token index similar to one of Balancer.</p>
